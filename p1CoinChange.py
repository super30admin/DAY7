"""
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different
 denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. 
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

// Time Complexity : O(A* N),  A= amount of change, N = amount of coins
// Space Complexity : O(A)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : syntax


// There are 2 approaches, top down and bottom up

// Time Complexity : O(N*k) where k is number of coins, and N is value of money
// Space Complexity :ON
